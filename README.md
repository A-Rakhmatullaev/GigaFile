App: GigaFile
Members: Akbarbek Rakhmatullaev

Things done for Checkpoint 3:
- Added custom class that extends from abstract FileObserver
- Real-time creation/renaming/deletion/etc. of files and folders
- Open a root directory by clicking twice on 'Files' button
- Back button that pops-up when entered into a new directory

List of features needed for the MVP + Breakdown of tasks:
- Display all possible* files and directories on chosen storage
- Modify these files and directories: rename, delete, move etc.
- Create files and directories
- Allow to switch storages, e.g internal to external
- Display memory consumption chart
- Allow to connect at least one cloud storage, such as Google Drive, in ideal to all of them

Mapping between features and value(s) to be delivered by your app (justification):
- Primary value was open-source nature of the app, and all these features' implementations can be examined by anyone
- Another value is ability to connect to a remote cloud storage of your own, which is supported by this app
